# Release Process & Deployment Reference

> Externalized: full runbook lives in default brain.

## Default Brain

- File vault: `brain/repo-harness/runbooks/runbook-agentic-release-deploy.md`
- gbrain slug: `runbooks/runbook-agentic-release-deploy`

## Repo Role

This repo keeps deployment contract surfaces under `deploy/` and private runtime
state under ignored `_ops/`. Detailed release patterns, Cloudflare examples, and
rollback playbooks belong in the external runbook.

## Release Filings

Release filing documents live under `deploy/release-checklists/` and must use a
`YYMMDD-<package>-<version>.md` filename, for example
`260531-repo-harness-0.1.3.md`. The filing records the exact release scope,
source commit, verification, publish status, and any hold reason. Do not rely
only on npm or GitHub release metadata for this local audit trail.
